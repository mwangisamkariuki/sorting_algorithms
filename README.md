# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
# General Objectives
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm

# Data Structure and Functions



# Task 0: Bubble sort.
    Write a function that sorts an array of integers in
    ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
    compares 2 elements (comparing one elements with one after it) and,
    swapping values if needed.
    These passes through the list repeatedly until no swap has to be done.
    meaning the list is fully sorted.
# Task 1:Isetion Sort
    it grows a sorted output list by comparison, one item at a time
    sorting is done in place.
    itinsetion removes one element from input data,
    finds the location it belongs to within the sorted list
    Inserts it there

# Task 2:Selection Sort
    in place comparison sorting
    The algorithm divides the input in to 2:
        sorted sub-list which is built up from left to right
        unsrted sublist:
    it picks a minimum number in the array and places it at the beggining of the unsorted array

# Task 3:Quick Sort
    Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
    It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and-
    partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
    according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason,
    it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.
# Task 4:
# Task 5:
# Task 6: Counting Sort
# Task 7: Merge Sort
    divide and conqur algorithm
    divides the unsorted list into n sublist
    each containing one element
    repeatedly, merge the sublist to produce the sorted list
# Task 8: Heap sort
    This is a comparison based algorithm
    it can be though t of as improved selection sort
    it divides its input into an unsorted region and
    iteratively shrinks the unsorted regions by removing the largest elements and inserts into the sorted region
